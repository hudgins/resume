Experience
----------
Feb 2015 - present : Bitaccess Inc. - bitaccess.com

Current Role: Principal Engineer

When I joined Bitaccess, it was a Y-Combinator-graduated startup with a fairly
nascent Bitcoin ATM product. In my time at the company (most of its life), I
helped the software team:
 - write a lot of Node-based REST microservices
 - build two experimental products (buybitcoincanada.com and faa.st)
 - grow from 5 to 25 developers
 - mature the Bitcoin ATM product and achieve a billion dollar lifetime volume.

Technologies:
 - Node.js, JavaScript/TypeScript, Express, NestJS, MongoDB, Datastore, Redis

Dec 2014 - Feb 2015 : Nureva Inc. - www.nureva.com

Role: Doesn't Matter

I was hired by Nureva to work on a from-scratch Node.js-based product,
but the company instead purchased a legacy PHP/Dojo product for us to
maintain. I ~~got the f~~ left to seek work elsewhere that better
matched my skills and interests.

May 2014 - Dec 2014 : hiatus

Role: Unemployed Dreamer & Wife-Concerner

I took several months off to try my hand at iOS game development.
I published three games during that time and made $11 in revenue,
all from friends. While writing this resume I watched some of the
gameplay videos and will admit I have no idea what's going on.

Technologies:
 - Objective-C, SpriteKit, XCode

June 2012 - May 2014: QNX Software Systems (Blackberry) - www.qnx.com

Role: Software Developer, Concept Development Group

At QNX I joined a small team building demos for trade shows like CES. Not being
much of a C-programmer, I opted to use web technologies to:
 - create ‘connected car’ concept demos using Node.js on QNX and web front-ends
 - maintain a QNX Node port (0.6 to 0.10) for my use and QNX customers such as Audi and Volkswagen
 - create an ‘in-dash app store’ prototype with another developer
 - develop a prototype QNX CAR media player REST API on a C-based Node native module
 - throw together a hacky live stream of the CES show floor for QNX employees using a
   webcam stream over websockets (jsmpeg)
 - (ridiculously) attend NodeConf 2013 on the company dime

Technologies:
 - Node.js, JavaScript, MongoDB, Redis, Websockets, MQTT

May 2010 - May 2012: Benbria Corporation - www.benbria.com

Role: Software Developer

At Benbria I made the transition from Java developer to Node.js developer by
convincing management to let me. The company had built its flagship product
on J2EE but for its new product idea (which appears to be their main focus
now), a couple of us made a case for switching to Node, despite having no
Javascript experience, and we all lived happily ever after.

Technologies:
 - JavaScript/CoffeeScript, MongoDB, Socket.io, Backbone.js

June 1998 - March 2010: SED Systems - www.sedsystems.com

Role: Systems Analyst or something stuffy like that

SED Systems builds satellite communications and test systems. I worked there a
hundred years ago. The following summary from an old resume seems like something
that happened to someone else at this point, but I'll include it for interest's sake.

During my time at SED I went from an entry-level Java programmer to a senior
software developer and system integrator. I worked as part of a small team
building and deploying a Monitor & Control system for satellite ground stations.
It was a Java and C++ client-server application with a Java-based system design
tool, for which I was largely responsible. A significant part of my time was
spent travelling to satellite uplink stations (across the US, Canada, Norway,
the Netherlands) and integrating the software system with the satellite equipment.
I learned (and have now largely forgotten) a lot about SNMP, RS232, GPIB, CORBA,
and XML. If I ever really understood any of the satellite communications stuff
I’ve certainly forgotten that too.
