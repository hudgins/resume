Summary
-------
I have the proven ability to rapidly build and launch 80% feature complete prototypes,
scale critical production systems to handle millions of requests per day,
and optimize software responsible for billions of dollars in value. I also have experience
leading and fostering development teams as they grow from a handful to dozens of developers.

Experience
----------
### Feb 2015 - Sept 2023: [Bitaccess Inc.](https://bitaccess.com)

#### Role: Principal Engineer

When I joined Bitaccess in 2015, it was a recent Y-Combinator grad with a fairly
nascent Bitcoin ATM (BTM) product and a small handful of developers. I wrote
a lot of the early software, much of which is still in production, and helped
grow the business from 60 ATMs to over 7000. I'm most proud of having grown
the software team from 5 to 25 while fostering an open, honest, caring,
and dedicated culture.

Some notable accomplishments over the years include:
 - 2015 - I replaced the BTM kiosk software upgrade process, moving it from
from a manual "ssh into each machine and git pull a bunch of repos" to an
automated docker-container-based upgrade.
 - 2016 - together with a front-end developer, I built Bitaccess'
BuyBitcoinCanada.com product, which was a non-custodial crypto exchange offering
BTC and ETH via voucher, debit, credit, and bank integrations.  While we
eventually sunsetted that product, the order processing system I built for it
now handles all BTM volume.
 - 2017 - I was part of another two-person team that built Faa.st, which was a
non-custodial "instant-exchange" allowing customers to swap cryptocurrencies.
We later transformed the product into a peer-to-peer mechanism with market-makers,
but ultimately opted to sunset it due to regulatory guidance.
 - 2018 - I was part of a major team effort to rewrite the BTM product to move most of
the software off the kiosk and into cloud services.
 - 2021 - Bitaccess became part of the El Salvador Bitcoin story, providing 100
BTMs. I worked with a member of my team to create a custom integration into the
government's Chivo wallet system.
 - 2022 - my team created a new fiat offramp for Bitcoin Depot which allows
customers to purchase crypto at over 10,000 retail outlets in the USA through a partnership
with a major gift card service provider.
 - 2023 - migrated services from Heroku to AWS, developed CI pipelines on Github Actions

#### Technologies:
 - Node.js, JavaScript, TypeScript, Express, NestJS, MongoDB, Datastore, Redis, Websockets, Github Actions

### Dec 2014 - Feb 2015 : [Nureva Inc.](https://nureva.com)

#### Role: Senior Developer

I was hired by Nureva to work on a from-scratch Node.js-based product, but prior
to my on-boarding the role was changed to the maintenance of a legacy PHP/Dojo application.
I left to seek work elsewhere that better matched my skills and interests.

### May 2014 - Dec 2014 : hiatus

#### Role: Unemployed Dreamer & Wife-Concerner

I took several months off to try my hand at iOS game development, learning
Objective-C and SpriteKit and publishing three games.

#### Technologies:
 - Objective-C, SpriteKit, XCode

### June 2012 - May 2014: [QNX Software Systems (Blackberry)](https://qnx.com)

#### Role: Software Developer, Concept Development Group

At QNX I joined a small team building marketing demos for trade shows like CES. I
introduced and leveraged web technologies to:
 - create â€˜connected carâ€™ concept demos using Node.js on QNX and web front-ends
 - maintain a QNX Node port (0.6 to 0.10) for my use and QNX customers such as Audi and Volkswagen
 - create an â€˜in-dash app storeâ€™ prototype with another developer
 - develop a prototype QNX CAR media player REST API on a C-based Node native module
 - throw together a hacky live stream of the CES show floor for QNX employees using a
   webcam stream over websockets (jsmpeg)

#### Technologies:
 - Node.js, JavaScript, MongoDB, Redis, Websockets, MQTT

### May 2010 - May 2012: [Benbria Corporation](https://benbria.com)

#### Role: Software Developer

At Benbria I made the transition from Java developer to Node.js developer by
convincing management to let the dev team try the fledgling Node.js platform
for their new project. It was a great success and in fact is the primary
focus of the company now.

#### Technologies:
 - JavaScript/CoffeeScript, MongoDB, Socket.io, Backbone.js

### June 1998 - March 2010: [SED Systems](https://www.calian.com/service-lines/advanced-technologies)

#### Role: Systems Analyst

SED Systems builds satellite communications and test systems.

During my time at SED I went from an entry-level Java programmer to a senior
software developer and system integrator. I worked as part of a small team
building and deploying a Monitor & Control system for satellite ground stations.
It was a Java and C++ client-server application with a Java-based system design
tool, for which I was largely responsible. A significant part of my time was
spent travelling to satellite uplink stations (across the US, Canada, Norway,
the Netherlands) and integrating the software system with the satellite equipment.
